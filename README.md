# NLP [NATURAL PROCESSING LANGUAGE]


Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Just wanted to drop a quick note about my latest venture on GitHub. I've recently uploaded a collection of NLP-based notebooks that I've been tinkering with. These little nuggets encapsulate my journey into the realm of Natural Language Processing, from sentiment analysis escapades to the intricacies of text generation. It's a medley of experimenting with pre-trained models, fine-tuning, and diving into the exciting world of named entity recognition and text classification. Feel free to take a peek, share your thoughts, or even better, let's geek out over some NLP magic together! ðŸš€
